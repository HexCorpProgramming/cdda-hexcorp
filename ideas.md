# Future ideas

## Items

- grafted suit/headphones/mask (only different in that they can not be taken off)
- more cute latex clothing
- blahaj? (for the memes)

## NPCs

- drones roaming around, randomly saying codes
- glitched enforcer drones, that will try to capture the player with stun weapons

## Locations

- HexCorp recruiting office (in town)
    - source of attire and high tech
    - drones roaming around
- Hive
    - concrete bunker entrance
    - large underground structure
    - climate controlled and easily defendable
    - lots of drones
